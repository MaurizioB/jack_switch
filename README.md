# jack_switch
A simple switcher for jack clients  
If you need to easily switch outputs of your jack program (e.g. testing equalization or compression against raw output, different output device or reverb type, ...), then jack_switch might be helpful.  
jack_switch is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, it's just a script I made up because I needed it, and I thought it might be useful to other users like you. For any issues you can contact me at maurizio.berti on gmail, just keep in mind that I'm no programmer, I just code for fun. Enjoy!
